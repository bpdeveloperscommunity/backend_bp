Here are examples of different CSS selectors and their corresponding specificity values:

1. `h1` (element selector): Specificity = 1-0-0-0
2. `.button` (class selector): Specificity = 0-0-1-0
3. `#header` (ID selector): Specificity = 0-1-0-0
4. `div p` (descendant selector): Specificity = 0-0-0-2
5. `a:hover` (pseudo-class selector): Specificity = 0-0-1-1
6. `::after` (pseudo-element selector): Specificity = 0-0-0-1

**Strategies for Managing and Resolving Specificity Issues:**








5. **Specificity Resets:** Use specificity resets like the universal selector (`*`) or more specific selectors to undo high-specificity rules when necessary.

6. **Order of Stylesheets:** Ensure that stylesheets are loaded in the correct order, with the most specific stylesheets loaded last to override less specific ones.


By following these strategies, you can effectively manage and resolve specificity issues in your CSS, leading to cleaner, more maintainable, and predictable styles for your web pages.
